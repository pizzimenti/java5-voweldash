# Java Week 1 - Vowel Dash - Unit and Integration testing with basic Java frameworks

## Description

Obfuscation of vowels to dashes through the use of Java's string 'replace' method within the for-each loop of a character array. The purpose of this program is to develop the skills to write:

- A simple method that can return a string after performing logic on it to a main function
- A main function that is capable of having VelocityTemplateEngine construct a basic web page that takes queries
- Unit tests that prove passing functionality of all functions/classes
- Integration tests that prove the site itself with set and get information from a Java program
